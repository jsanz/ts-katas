# TypeScript exercises

I will push here exercises to learn TypeScript/JavaScript focusing in testing, data structures, mocking, etc. Each folder should be auto inclusive and totally independent from the rest of the exercises, unless it's explicitly mentioned.

I would like to improve the `00-template` folder with better settings to start new katas or projects, specially regarding configuration of linters, testing, etc.
